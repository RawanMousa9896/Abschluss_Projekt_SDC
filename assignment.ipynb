    "# Homework Assignment: Serving Models with Docker, TensorFlowServe, and TorchServe\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you learned how to serve machine learning models using **TensorFlowServe**, **TorchServe**, and **Docker** (with **Docker Compose**). Your task now is to apply these concepts by creating a full application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Docker Compose Setup**:\n",
    "   - Set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to serve a machine learning model using **TensorFlowServe** or **TorchServe**.\n",
    "   - The docker-compose should also boot a frontend/backend app\n",
    "   - You can use one of the models we worked with during the lab session, or feel free to choose a model of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build a Frontend, e.g. streamlit (and optionally a Backend)**:\n",
    "   - Create a simple frontend interface that allows users to upload an image.\n",
    "   - The frontend should interact with the served model to make predictions (i.e., run an inference) on the uploaded image.\n",
    "   - Optionally, you can build a backend to handle the communication between the frontend and the model server, though this is not mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "- **Model Serving**: You must serve a model using **TensorFlowServe** or **TorchServe**.\n",
    "- **Image Upload**: Your frontend should have functionality to upload an image.\n",
    "- **Inference**: After uploading the image, the application should run an inference on the image using the served model and display the prediction result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Bonus (Optional):\n",
    "- Integrate a backend to handle requests between the frontend and model server.\n",
    "- Customize the UI to make it more user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "- A working **Docker Compose** setup that serves the model, runs a frontend/backend and handles communication.\n",
    "- A frontend that can upload images and display inference results.\n",
    "- (Optional) A backend that connects the frontend to the model server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to test your solution and include a README file explaining how to run your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
